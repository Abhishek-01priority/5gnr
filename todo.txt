- Add all the pointer after mem allocation to a list so that when free() is called after IFFT, all the pointers in the list
  can be freed one-by-one


NRBG = 6 -> number of 16 QAM RBGs for which EVM needs to be measured
Number of QPSK PRBs within a slot for which EVM is not measured = Nrb - 3 - P * Nrbg
								= 24 - 3 - 2 * 6
								= 9
This is number of PRBs after PRB#2. And only RNTI0 (which is u allocated after PRB#2) is QPSK
Hence this is the number of PRBs for RNTI0

This also means that number of PRBs for RNTI1 = 24 - 9 - 3 = 12
